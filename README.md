Performed Grid Search on Social_Network_Ads.csv

# STEPS IN GRID SEARCH

-> Importing the libraries

-> Importing the dataset

-> Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set

-> Feature Scaling

-> Training the Kernel SVM model on the Training set

-> Making the Confusion Matrix

-> Applying k-Fold Cross Validation

-> Applying Grid Search to find the best model and the best parameters

-> Visualising the Training set results

-> Visualising the Test set results
